<p>You can run this on a virtual python environment.</p>

<br/>
<p>Example for MacOS and Linux,</p>

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

<p>Kill the terminal and start a new one.
You should now be able to see that you are in a python virtual environment</p>

Note that python version 3.10.5 and later does not support pygame at this time.</p>
